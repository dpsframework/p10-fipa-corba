## Proposal status

- **modified**:  '2022-06-18'
- **status**:  'Completed'
- **title**:  'Proposal: compile FIPA module with Java JDK-17'
- **subtitle**:  'Proposal: integration study of the CORBA library used by FIPA and its possibility of adapting to the OpenJDK-17 Java compiler'
- **abstract**:  'The FIPA module belonging to JADE 4.5.4 requires the GlassFish CORBA ORB libraries for its compilation. Before migrating from JADE 4.5.4 r6867 to Java OpenJDK-17, it is necessary to check the behavior of FIPA with higher versions of Java.'


##  To-Do List:
- [x]  \(1) Achieve FIPA module compliance with the Java Platform Module System[^migra17] (JPMS) specifications.
- [x]  \(2) Separate the FIPA module from JADE and study the particular compilation requirements with Oracle Java[^java] JDK-11 through JDK-17 LTS and higher. Further study, how to compile with OpenJDK[^openJDK] versions from openJDK-11 to OpenJDK-18.
- [x]  \(3) Modify the FIPA Objects that prevent compiling with higher versions. Document the changes and check their integration with the JADE platform.
- [x]  \(4) Analyze the javax used by FIPA.
- [x]  \(5) Analyze GlassFish CORBA used by FIPA.
- [x]  \(6) Prepare as a GitHub repository for download and evaluation.



### The proposed module: `module-info.java` 

```java

module org.fipa {
	exports FIPA to com.tilab.jade;
	
	exports org.omg.CORBA to com.tilab.jade;
	exports org.omg.CosNaming to com.tilab.jade;
	
	requires java.rmi;
	requires java.desktop;
	requires java.base;
}
```

### A raw compilation and packaging


```shell

Windows:
-----------
dir /s/b *.java   >  sources.txt
javac --module-path org.fipa @sources.txt -d builded/org.fipa -verbose
jar -cvf org.fipa-2002.jar builded/org.fipa/module-info.class -C builded/org.fipa .



GNU and OS-X:    
------------
find . -iname *java -type f   >   sources.txt
javac --module-path org.fipa @sources.txt -d builded/org.fipa -verbose
jar -cvf org.fipa-2002.jar builded/org.fipa/module-info.class -C builded/org.fipa .

  
```


## Proposal description
 

##   Section 1: Identification
-  Responsible for the proposal: FJAC
-  Proposal date: January, 2022.
-  Results location: GitHub

##   Section 2: Update
-  OpenJDK-11 to OpenJDK-18 compiler are used.
-  FIPA implementation made by JADE in 2002 is used.

###  2.1. Description of the proposal:

-  It is proposed to temporarily extract the FIPA module from the core of the JADE platform development. Since, with the current version of Java JDK-18 or higher, it is no longer possible to compile JADE. This is caused because the CORBA libraries have been removed from the core of the Java SE Standard releases and the Java JDK development release versions 17 and higher.
-  Once the FIPA separation of the JADE core has been carried out, it will be possible to know the scope of the necessary changes in the FIPA module; know which are the necessary libraries of GlassFish of CORBA ORB to achieve optimal stability; and allow later integration of the FIPA module with JADE compiled with OpenJDK-17 or higher.

###  2.2. Target platform
-  Java SE 17, OpenJDK-17 or higher, Java JDK-17 or higher. This implies that it can be used in Desktop or Server environments, with different architectures and operating systems.
  
-  The final objective is its integration in JADE 4.5.4, and to wait for a future revision of JADE.




###  23. What does the update proposal need?
-  Access to the code of the FIPA module of the JADE Platform. Found at: <https://jade.tilab.com/svn/jade/trunk/>
-  A development environment. Eclipse 2021-12 has been used.
-  A detailed compilation of the errors offered by the OpenJDK-17/ Java JDK-17 compiler; its progressive correction; the incorporation of the Java Platform Module System to allow later integration of this FIPA module with the JADE platform.


###  2.4. Why this proposal?
-  Because the evolution of the Java compiler has removed the CORBA libraries from the Java core.
-  Because it is not possible to compile the JADE Platform on top of Java OpenJDK-17. The only way is to add the GlassFish CORBA ORB libraries to the CLASSPATH. Requiring, in turn, the distribution of JADE with these specific libraries.






###  2.5. Underlying technology or technologies:
-  OpenJDK-9 to OpenJDK18.
-  Oracle Java JDK-9 through Oracle Java JDK-18.
-  GlassFish CORBA ORB 2.4









###  2.6. Package name for API proposal?
-  File: **org-fipa-2002.jar**
-  Package: **FIPA**













###  2.7. Dependencies on specific operating systems
-  Those corresponding to the version and architecture of the Java compiler.












###  2.8. Security issues due to the current security model
-  They have not been analyzed.














###  2.9. Internationalization or localization problems?
-  They have not been implemented.















###  2.10. Any need for revision as a result of this work?
-  It has not been planned. Awaiting review.
















###  2.11. Schedule for the development of this proposal
-   Start: **January 2022**
-   End: **July 2022**
















##   Section 3: Contributions




###  3.1. Documents, proposals or implementations that describe the technology.















###  3.2. Starting point of the work.
-   FIPA module implemented by TILAB, within the development of JADE.
